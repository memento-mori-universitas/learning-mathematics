What is mathematics? The Science of Patterns

Banach-Tarski Paradox: Take a sphere and cut it up in such a way that you reassemble it to form two identical spheres, each the same size the origin size

The first use of of the number was money around 10,000 years ago.

In the nineteenth century, the primary focus in mathematics became concepts and relationships.

A major change in the nature of mathematics in  the 19th century is that mathematics became more abstract.

Getting precise about language

“One American dies of melanoma almost every hour” 
Take this sentence literally it refers about one person who dies every hour and resurrects only to die again. The sentence should read like this: 
“Almost every hour, an American dies of melanoma”.

The primary means to determine the truth in mathematics is proof.

Statement: There are infinite number of primes

Proof: Euclid’s:  N = ( p1 …. p2) +1 





Almost every key statement of mathematics is a positive or negative version of one our four linguistic forms:
Object a has property P
3 is a prime number
Every object of type T has property P
Every polynomial equations has a complex root
There is an object of type T having property P
There is an prime number between 20 and 25
If statement A, then statement B
If p is a prime of the form 4n + 1, then p is a sum of two squares.

Keywords in mathematics:

#### Assignment 1

1.Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence
The man saw the woman with a telescope, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope.
KIDS MAKE NUTRITIOUS SNACKS
STOLEN PAINTING FOUND BY TREE

2. For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:
Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway
After ten years sisters reunited in a checkout line at a Safeway
Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
City authorities are investigating large hole that appeared in High Street
Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.
Mayor says bus passengers should wear seat belts.

3. The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room: 
No head injury is too trivial to ignore.
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)
    Any head injuries should never be ignored
 
4. You often see the following notice posted in elevators:
    In case of fire, do not use elevator
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)
    The first meaning talks about how in case of a fire or an emergency, people should not use elevators, the second meaning could be interpreted as use the elevator in case of a fire or do not use the elevator to extinguish the fire. A rewrite of this sentence could be, “Avoid taking the elevator if the building is on fire” or “Take the stairs if building is on fire”. 

5. Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the bottom:
    This page intentionally left blank

Does  the  sentence  make  a  true  statement? 
    The statement is not true since the blank page is no longer blank by adding that sentence
What  is  the  purpose  of  making  such  a  statement?
    The purpose of the statement is to indicate to the person that the blank page was intentionally left blank.
What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again,
the  context  means  that  in  practice  everyone  understands  the  intended  meaning  and  there  is  no problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in an entire branch of mathematics.)
    The rest of the page is intentionally left blank

6.  Find  (and  provide  citations  for)  three  examples  of  published  sentences  whose  literal  meaning  is (clearly) not what the writer intended. [This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is very common.]

GTA drivers facing slick, messy roads(https://www.cp24.com/)
Sorry Alberta Conservatives, the Carbon Tax Is Not Costing a Church $50,000 a Year(https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/evenxj/sorry-alberta-conservatives-the-carbon-tax-is-not-costing-a-church-dollar50000-a-year)
This Guy Saved a Woman's Life with CPR He Learned from 'The Office' (https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/8xynav/man-saves-womans-life-with-cpr-he-learned-from-the-office-vgtrn)

7. Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in mathematics would be disastrous.
    The sentence is vague as it does not state temperature in its intended measurement (celsius or fahrenheit) but rather through the use of adverbs.

8. If the result of N is not divisible by any of the prime numbers    
    
    

#### Assignment 2 - Logical Combinators

And: ^ &
Ø: Phi
Ψ: Psi

Ø & Ψ is true if both are true
Ø & Ψ is false if one or both are false

The & is the conjunction of Ø and Ψ

In mathematical palettes, conjunction is commutative. It is the principle that the conjuncts of a logical conjunction may switch places with each other, while preserving the truth-value of the resulting proposition.

However in english, this is not always true that conjunction is commutative. For example:

John took the free kick and the ball went into the net.
The ball went into the net and John took the free kick.

In this case, changing the order does have change the meaning or value.

Or operator

There are two kinds of or:

Inclusive or: A or B or both.
Exclusive or: Either A or B but not both.

In mathematics “or” means inclusive or. 

The or symbol is a “v” and is called a disjuction


**Not operator**
